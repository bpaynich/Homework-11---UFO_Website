Homework-11---Javascript <br/>
3/18/2019 <br/>

This homework was a demostration of Javascript fundamentals.   In this homework, there was a dataset that contained ufo sighting information.  This homework read in the data, and displayed the sighting information in an html table.  In addition, I built filter code that listened for changes in the datetime field.  When the submit button was clicked the table data was refreshed to display the selected date.   

The algorythm displayed all the data.  Once the requested date was selected, a new table was built with the filtered data.  The existing table was removed and replaced with the filteredData table.

In addition, some of the formatting was modified to capitalize the City, State, and Country fields using a caplitalize function as well as using the javascript .toUpperCase() function.
